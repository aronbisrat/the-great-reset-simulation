# 🧠 The Great Reset Simulation

A bold, data-driven thought experiment imagining a world where the global 1% forgives all debt — how would it impact wealth inequality, economic freedom, and global power?

## 🔍 Problem Statement

What if the ultra-rich voluntarily forgave **all personal, national, and institutional debt**? This project simulates that scenario, inspired by real-world economic inequality and a vision for structural reset.

## 📊 Dataset & Simulation

- Data is synthetically generated for demonstration
- Simulation models debt relief impact on multiple social tiers
- Visualizations track pre- and post-reset conditions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub  
- [Kaggle Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aronbisrat/the-great-reset-simulation)

## 📈 Sample Outputs

Include images like:

## 📖 Storytelling

A short speculative story is included to contextualize the model in a near-future scenario.

## 🚀 How to Use

Clone the repo and run the notebook:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aronbisrat/the-great-reset-simulation
cd the-great-reset-simulation
jupyter notebook Debt_Reset_Simulation.ipynb
```
## 🎯 Inspiration

This project was inspired by discussions around the World Economic Forum’s "Great Reset" concept, and by real-world concerns about global debt, inequality, and the power dynamics of wealth. It aims to explore a radical scenario through data-driven simulation and storytelling.
